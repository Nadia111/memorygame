# Memory Game Project


## Game Overview

 This is a 'Udacity FEND' Project.
 
 Memory Game is a game that tests your memory by testing how fast you learn the order of cards.
 There is a set of sixteen cards (eight pairs), randomly placed in a container, you try to open two similar cards.
 In the process if the pair of cards you open do match, they are left open, and if they don't, they are flipped over.
 You win the game when they all match.
 There is a counter of moves, stars' levels and a timer to measure how fast you are.
